## Hey there! 👋 I'm Harry

**Senior Code Wizard** 🧙‍♂️ who turns coffee into distributed systems and occasionally debugs production at 3 AM (but who's counting? ☕).

When I'm not busy teaching robots to talk to each other via microservices, you'll find me automating everything that moves and some things that don't.

### 🛠️ My Magical Toolkit

**Backend Spells** ✨
- Java ☕
- Python 🐍
- Apache Kafka 🚀

**Infrastructure Wizardry** 🔮
- Kubernetes ⚙️ (making containers dance)
- Docker 🐳 (containerizing all the things)
- MySQL/PostgreSQL 🗄️ (database whispering)
- Prometheus & Grafana 📊 (pretty charts from chaos)

**Architecture Philosophy** 🏛️
- Microservices (because monoliths are so last decade)
- Event-Driven Architecture (async is the way)
- "It works on my machine" → "It works everywhere"

### 🎯 Currently Obsessing Over
- 🚀 Building systems that don't break at 2 AM
- 🤖 Teaching React to play nice with my backend
- 🧠 Designing architectures that scale better than my coffee addiction
- 🔥 Making infrastructure so reliable, it's boring (in a good way)
